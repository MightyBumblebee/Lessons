<!--target specifies where the linked resource will be opened. If it is not present, then, by default, it will take on the _self value which opens the link in the current tab. To open the link in a new tab or window (depends on browser settings) you can set it to _blank-->

<!--You may have noticed that we snuck in the rel attribute above. This attribute is used to describe the relation between the current page and the linked document.

The noopener value prevents the opened link from gaining access to the webpage from which it was opened. The noreferrer value prevents the opened link from knowing which webpage or resource has a link (or ‘reference’) to it. It also includes the noopener behaviour and thus can be used by itself as well.
